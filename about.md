# About Us

Open Sky Law, PLLC is an immigration law practice located in Kent, Washington. We have over 20 years of  legal experience, handling complex immigration matters before USCIS, the Department of State and Federal Courts. Our team is highly skilled and has represented hundreds of men, women, and children from five continents in vast areas ranging from citizenship applications, non-immigrant petitions, applications for survivors of crime/trafficking, and family based petitions. We are innovative, fearless, and knowledgeable. We provide an integrated and customized approach to each case by collaborating with experts, advocates and counselors when necessary. We believe that every client's situation and background is unique and that each case should be handled with personalized attention, detail, and dedication. Our bottom line is that we care about clients.

The practice of law is a powerful tool for eliminating oppression through advocacy and mobilization, but also for instigating change at an individual and societal level. Winning a case is one step in a broader social justice movement. Each time an asylum case is won, a judgeâ€™s knowledge about a culture has broadened while a law enforcement official has learned that violence crosses all genders, cultures, and socioeconomic classes.

Our practice involves a daily process of discovery and education that cannot be acquired from textbooks alone. Each case is carefully handled given the broader implications of the immigrant rights' movement.

We are committed to providing cost effective and exceptional legal services. We believe in empowering our clients with the necessary tools to make informed decisions.
