  <p>Most of our clients have never hired a lawyer before. We always start the process with a one-hour consultation. This provides an opportunity for us to meet each other, gives you the chance to meet us and ask us questions about your case, and provides some time for us to learn about your legal situation so we can determine the best course of action. A consultation is not an agreement to provide ongoing legal services to you in your case. During the consultation, our attorneys will discuss your legal situation with you and determine what options are available to you to help solve your immigration situation. Each case is different, and for that reason, we cannot quote a price for your case without first doing a consultation with you so we can fully understand your situation.</p>

<p>Our office is quite busy, and as a result, we do ask for a $50 deposit at the time of scheduling your appointment. If you need to cancel or reschedule, you need to contact us at least one business day in advance of your appointment.</p>

<h3 id="in-office-consultations">In-office consultations</h3>

<p>We would like to invite you to schedule a consultation with one of our attorneys at our offices in Kent, Washington. Our consultation fee for a one-hour meeting with our attorneys is $350.00, payable in advance. Please be sure to bring with you any documents that relate to your immigration case. If you have ever received any paperwork from U.S. immigration, please bring it with you to the appointment so that we can properly analyze your situation. Additionally, if you have ever been arrested or convicted for any criminal matter anywhere in the world, please bring any documents relating to the incident with you to your appointment.</p>

<h3 id="telephonic-consultations">Telephonic consultations</h3>

<p>If you are not located in the greater Seattle area, we can also do a telephonic consultation. Our telephonic consultation fee is also $350. We do ask that you send all relevant documents about your immigration case to us in advance of your appointment so that we will be able to review them during the consultation and provide you with the most thorough analysis of your case.</p>

<h3 id="detained-consultations">Detained consultations</h3>

<p>Our attorneys are also able to meet with detained individuals at either the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, the Seatac Federal Detention facility in SeaTac, Washington, and the King County Jail in downtown Seattle. Detained consultations do require additional time for travel and accordingly our fee is $550. Please be sure to either bring any documents that are related to your case with you to the appointment, or have a trusted family member or friend upload copies to our secure website prior to the appointment.</p>

<h3 id="attorney-consultations">Attorney consultations</h3>

<p>Our attorneys have frequently provided services to other attorneys to assist in their cases. These services include being local counsel for federal district court actions and providing expert advice regarding immigration matters, including advice to criminal defense attorneys seeking to ensure that their clients are fully aware of any immigration consequences before accepting a proposed plea deal. These services are generally billed hourly. Please contact us for more details.</p>

<h3 id="preparing-for-your-appointment">Preparing for your appointment</h3>

<p>In order for the appointment to be the most helpful to you, it is important to try to bring the following documents about your (or your relative or friend’s case):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Current and prior passports, and I-94’s (or copies).</li>
  <li>Any prior applications (with the supporting documents) submitted to U.S. Immigration, the U.S. consulate, or the Department of Labor, plus any notices, receipts, or decisions regarding those applications. If you have ever been represented by another attorney, please ask that attorney for a copy of your file. Your prior lawyer should have these important documents and is required to give them to you</li>
  <li>If you have ever been in deportation or removal proceedings, copies of any documents concerning those proceedings, such as the Notice to Appear, Immigration Judge/BIA or circuit court decisions and briefs. Your prior lawyer should have these and is required to give them to you.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you have any criminal record, copies of the criminal court file (especially the docket, and the judgment and sentence). Copies are available at the court house, or from your criminal defense attorney. Following the consult, the attorney will determine whether you can be accepted as a client and how to proceed.</p>
